# Car Price Prediction (Linear Regression)

## Objective
Predict the selling price of used cars using Linear Regression.

## Dataset
- Source: Quikr Car Dataset
- Cleaned version: `Cleaned_car.csv`
- Features include: location, kms, mileage, fuel type, etc.

## Steps
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing
2. EDA & visualization
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training (Linear Regression)
5. Evaluation (MAE, RMSE, R²)
6. Saving model as `.pkl`

## Results
R²:  
MAE:  
RMSE:

## Files
- `car_price_prediction.ipynb` – main notebook  
- `Cleaned_car.csv` – cleaned dataset  
- `quikr_car.csv` – raw data  
- `CarPricePredictor.pkl` – trained model  

## Future Improvements
- Try Random Forest  
- Deploy using Flask or Streamlit
